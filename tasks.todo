Remember:
    Tokenizer job is to parse the code string and output tokens
    Parser job is to validate the syntax and create AST
    ModuleResolver job is to order the modules in seprate ASTs
    SemanticAnalyzer job is to validate the scopes and types 
    Generator job is to generate Javascript 

Generator: 
    ☐ buffer.ts and source-map.ts need to be refactor for using Cylon parser output

SemanticAnalyzer:
    ☐ create it :)
